# Learning Go

Welcome to my Go Learning Repository! This is a collection of `Go` programs and projects that I am working on as I learn the Go programming language.

## Contents

- Various `Go` programs demonstrating different concepts and features of the language.
- Code snippets and examples for practice and reference.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/m3hu1/learning-go.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd learning-go/<project-directory>
   ```
3. Run any Go file using:
   ```
   go run <filename.go>
   ```
> [!TIP]
> You can also compile the programs using `go build <filename.go>`. This will allow you to run the programs using `./<filename>`.
